# OWL SEMAPHORE — INTEGRITY MANIFEST

## Version 1.0.0

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the integrity regime for the Owl Semaphore repository.

Its purpose is to make the repository auditable, reproducible, and resistant to silent drift. No asset, specification, export, or derived file is to be treated as authoritative merely because it looks correct. Authority requires verification.

This manifest exists to record:

- file identity
- file role
- transform class
- transparency claims
- cryptographic hash values
- verification procedures
- failure conditions

---

## 2. Integrity Doctrine

The Owl Semaphore is a constrained epistemic system. Its visual and textual artifacts therefore require the same treatment as any other standards-bound technical asset.

The governing principle is simple:

> A file is not canonical because it appears correct. It is canonical because it verifies against the system’s declared invariants.

For this reason, integrity is evaluated along four axes:

1. structural correctness
2. transform correctness
3. transparency correctness
4. cryptographic identity

---

## 3. Integrity Scope

This manifest applies to the following categories of repository content:

### 3.1 Specification Documents

- `OWL-SEMAPHORE-SYSTEM.md`
- `OWL-1-NORMATIVE.md`
- `OWL-2-NON-NORMATIVE.md`
- `OWL-3-CRITICAL.md`
- `OWL-4-METACOGNITIVE.md`
- `README.md`
- `CITATION.cff`

### 3.2 Asset Files

All files under:

- `assets/masters/`
- `assets/layers/`
- `assets/exports/`

### 3.3 Validation and Publication Files

- `INTEGRITY-MANIFEST.md`
- validation reports
- release notes
- DOI metadata outputs

---

## 4. Hash Standard

### 4.1 Algorithm

The canonical hash algorithm for this repository is:

**SHA-3-512**

### 4.2 Rationale

SHA-3-512 is used because it provides strong cryptographic identity checking and aligns with the project’s requirement for explicit, modern integrity controls.

### 4.3 Canonical Verification Command

```bash
openssl dgst -sha3-512 <filename>
```

### 4.4 Directory Verification Example

```bash
find . -type f \
  ! -path './.git/*' \
  ! -path './.DS_Store' \
  -exec openssl dgst -sha3-512 {} \;
```

---

## 5. Transparency Integrity Rules

For any file labeled or published as transparent, the following conditions must hold:

- image mode must support alpha
- corner alpha values must equal 0
- the composited badge center must be fully opaque where the design requires it
- transparency may not be simulated by placing an RGB image on a neutral background and calling it transparent

### 5.1 Canonical Transparency Conditions

For canonical transparent composite badge files:

- mode = RGBA
- corner alpha = 0
- center alpha = 255

### 5.2 Failure Condition

Any file that claims transparency while lacking actual alpha information fails integrity review.

---

## 6. Transform Integrity Rules

The Owl Semaphore is defined by the Klein four-group:

$$
V_4 = \{I, \sigma_v, C_2, \sigma_h\}
$$

Each owl state must verify against its correct transform class.

### 6.1 Canonical State Map

| State | Operator | Required Orientation |
|------|----------|----------------------|
| NORMATIVE | I | upright, right-facing |
| NON-NORMATIVE | σᵥ | upright, left-facing |
| CRITICAL | C₂ | upside down, left-facing |
| METACOGNITIVE | σₕ | upside down, right-facing |

### 6.2 Failure Condition

Any file whose rendered orientation does not match its assigned operator fails integrity review.

### 6.3 State vs Process

The measured ~31° rotation does not belong to the canonical state system and must not be treated as a fifth badge state.

It is a process operator, not an integrity-valid state assignment.

---

## 7. Geometry Integrity Rules

All four states must preserve the shared geometric architecture of the system.

### 7.1 Shared Invariants

The following must remain invariant across all canonical owl states:

- common image center
- common outer ring geometry
- common meander ring geometry
- common annular structure
- common layer model

### 7.2 Failure Conditions

A file fails geometry integrity if any of the following occur:

- off-center placement
- scaling drift
- ring thickness drift
- meander deformation
- arbitrary translation
- undocumented cropping that changes the canonical structure

---

## 8. State-Specific Integrity Conditions

### 8.1 NORMATIVE

Must satisfy:

- identity transform only
- upright orientation
- right-facing owl
- normative gold / near-black palette
- no reflection
- no rotation

### 8.2 NON-NORMATIVE

Must satisfy:

- exact horizontal reflection relative to normative
- upright orientation
- left-facing owl
- teal / cool gray palette
- no 180° rotation

### 8.3 CRITICAL

Must satisfy:

- exact 180° rotation relative to normative
- upside-down orientation
- left-facing owl
- red / warm red palette
- clipping rule preserved if applied in the canonical asset set

### 8.4 METACOGNITIVE

Must satisfy:

- exact vertical reflection relative to normative
- upside-down orientation
- right-facing owl
- amethyst / deep violet-black palette
- meander preserved

---

## 9. Specification Document Integrity

The repository’s specification files are part of the canonical system and therefore require structural integrity checking.

### 9.1 Minimum Conditions

Each specification document must preserve:

- complete heading hierarchy
- non-truncated lists
- mathematically correct operator assignments
- non-conflated epistemic roles
- consistent terminology across the full repository

### 9.2 Failure Conditions

A specification document fails integrity if it contains:

- broken section structure
- truncated checklists
- inconsistent operator mapping
- state/process conflation
- conflicting color doctrine
- conflicting geometry claims

---

## 12. Validation Procedure

### 12.1 Order of Operations

1. confirm required files exist
2. validate specification structure
3. validate image dimensions and modes
4. validate orientation and transform class
5. validate geometry invariants
6. validate alpha integrity
7. compute SHA-3-512 hashes
8. record values in this manifest
9. mark validated files as `VERIFIED` or `LOCKED`

### 12.2 Strict Release Rule

No file may be promoted to release status until all applicable integrity checks pass.

---

## 13. Release Integrity Policy

Before any tagged public release:

- all root documents must be complete
- all canonical assets must be validated
- all published hashes must be current
- `CITATION.cff` must reflect the release version
- Zenodo metadata must match repository state

---

## 14. Misuse and Drift Policy

This repository is especially vulnerable to silent semantic drift if assets are treated as design variants instead of constrained epistemic states.

The following are considered integrity violations even when they appear visually subtle:

- arbitrary recoloring
- transform substitution
- state/process conflation
- geometry drift
- silent asset replacement
- undocumented semantic reassignment

---

## 15. Closing Statement

The Owl Semaphore is not a decorative icon set. It is a formal system. Its files therefore require formal verification.

This manifest is the repository’s integrity backbone.

If a file cannot be verified, it does not become canonical by familiarity, convenience, or visual plausibility.

It becomes canonical only by passing the constraints defined here.
